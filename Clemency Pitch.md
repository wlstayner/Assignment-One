# Assignment-One

I'd like to do my assignment by creating a page that shows the numbers of clemencies granted by presidents. It can also include the number of clemency requests recieved, number of requests turned down and number of requests that are pending as well as a percentage of overall requests approved. The data is here (https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-statistics). I'm in the journalism school's clemency class, so this assignment would help me learn more about something I'm working on/interested in.
