<p>More than seven decades after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt left office, he still leads presidents in clemencies granted over the last 120 years. That data comes from <a href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-statistics"> The United States Department of Justice </a> which has been tracking clemency since 1900, when the William McKinley administration was in place.</p>
<p>Roosevelt has one of the most progressive resumes for any president ever, and had more years in office to grant clemency because he’s the only president to serve twelve years.
But more than bolstering Rooselevet’s progressive legacy, the clemency data illustrates how modern presidents have mostly failed to build on the use of clemency over the last century. Clemency can be granted through governors or presidents and needs no outside approval, making it a simple way to free people from prison. Commutations and pardons are the two most-used forms of clemency. Pardons erase past crimes and restore civil rights, while commutations partially or fully reduce a person’s sentence.
<p>Republican presidents George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush and Donald Trump have granted the fewest clemencies of any presidents during the 1900s, with 77 clemencies, 200 clemencies and 237 clemencies, respectively.
They also hold the three lowest clemency approval rates, granting between two to five percent of clemency applications. The Bushes and Trump all held “tough-on-crime” positions while in office, although Trump did oversee the passage of the First Step Act, which cut long federal prison sentences.</p>
<p>Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, is the one modern president who ranks in the top five for clemencies granted, approving 1,927 clemencies. Still, Obama is tied with the elder Bush for the fourth lowest clemency approval rate (5 percent) since 1900, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/22/trump-used-his-clemency-power-sparingly-despite-a-raft-of-late-pardons-and-commutations/"> according to the Pew Research Center</a>.
That’s in large part because Obama received 36,544 clemency applications, more than twice as much as Roosevelt — second most applications — and nearly 25 times as much as H.W. Bush, who received the fewest applications.
Obama clemencies were split between 1,715 commutations and 212 pardons. It’s an odd combination, putting Obama in the bottom-five for pardons, but top-five for clemency.
Obama’s high clemency application amount and low approval percentage rate probably point to just how politically unwieldy clemency is. Presidential “tough-on-crime” stances took off under President Richard Nixon in the 1970s, and began America’s path to mass incarceration.
<p>While laws passed under Obama and Trump have progressively reformed some of the country’s criminal justice system, even the most forgiving presidents in modern history are still susceptible to political blowback when they decide to free incarcerated people. And because of that, as you can see in the data, presidents still limit their clemency powers today.</p>
